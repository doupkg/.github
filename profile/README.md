## TL;DW (too long; didn't wait)

We're the crew jamming commits like it's a speedrun marathon. Vim full screen, neon lights on, yak shaving banned. The goal: launch crispy product vibes before the coffee gets cold and make this org profile feel like a backstage pass, not a museum plaque.

## ⚔️ Non-negotiables

- Default stance: ship now, optimize by lunch, meme by happy hour.
- DX so smooth you could nap on it. (You won't. ThePrimeagen would roast you.)
- Community-first even when we're sleep-deprived and yelling about TypeScript types.
- Every release should feel like finding a legendary drop in an S-tier dungeon.

## 🔥 What X.com is yelling about (probably)

> We check trends between espresso refills. If the feed flipped since this was written, blame Elon, not us.

- **#ShipItOrQuitIt** — because half the timeline just merged something spicy.
- **#VimGang** — obviously trending; modal editors never sleep.
- **#TypeSafetyDrama** — someone discovered `any` in production again.
- **#CoffeeFirstCommits** — health tip: hydrate, then caffeinate, then PR blast.
- **#AIandChill** — models generating memes faster than we can review them.

## 🧠 Stack we speedrun

| Layer | Favorite toy | Why it slaps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js + Tailwind | Fast, flashy, keeps the vibes reactive. |
| Mobile | React Native | One codebase, infinite bug hunts, zero boredom. |
| Backend | tRPC + Postgres | Type safe or bust. |
| Infra | Fly.io + Terraform | Deploy like you mean it. |
| Data | ClickHouse + DuckDB | Analytics with punchy latency. |
| AI | OpenAI + resident gremlins | Pair-programming with a silicon co-pilot. |

## 🚀 Currently shipping

```
S Tier 🔥   - OrbitX neon redesign (ship party every Friday)
A Tier ⚡   - NovaMesh components (designers yelling "just one more variant")
B Tier 🛠️  - SignalForge telemetry lore (turn logs into shareable plot twists)
Undead 🧟  - Holodeck onboarding (if QA survives, it launches)
```

## 🧪 Experiments cooking right now

- Building a trends bot that yells Primeagen quotes when the repo gets dusty.
- Crafting release notes like mixtapes. Track 01: "Refactor with Vengeance".
- Designing onboarding quests that feel like open-world tutorials, not HR paperwork.

## 🛡️ Culture cheat codes

- **Latency beats legacy.** Momentum is the cardio that keeps the org young.
- **Critique is a love language.** Roast the code, dap the humans.
- **Celebrate loudly.** GIFs, horns, custom terminal themes — everything counts.
- **Stay curious.** Shipping is fun, but so is poking at weird tech at 2 a.m.

## 📬 Pull up and hang

- Slide into **hello@supercharge.space** with your wildest idea. Expect a Loom demo back.
- Stalk our chaos on [X](https://twitter.com/) and pretend it's part of your OKRs.
- Want to build with us? Ship a mini proof-of-concept, drop a link, and let's go.

> Final boss energy: "Future isn't promised — it's compiled." Now get back to your terminal.
