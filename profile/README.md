## 🔭 Our North Star

> ✨ We design systems that feel like magic, behave like science, and scale with intent.

- Elevate organizations with product ecosystems that are resilient, inclusive, and joyful to use.
- Prototype at light-speed without compromising on engineering rigor or craft.
- Champion a culture where learning loops, experimentation, and bold vision fuel every launch.

## 🛰️ Focus Quests

| Quest | Why it matters | Current pulse |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OrbitX** | Reinventing the org profile so every visitor steps into our universe instantly. | 🟢 Shipping iterations weekly |
| **NovaMesh** | A design system that merges accessibility, storytelling, and modular UX atoms. | 🟠 In collaborative design review |
| **SignalForge** | Observability tooling that turns product telemetry into narrative insights. | 🟣 R&amp;D spike underway |

## 🧪 Experimental Lab

- [x] Quantum backlog prioritization sessions (rapid scenario mapping with the entire orbit).
- [x] Narrative prototyping: release notes that read like missions, not chores.
- [ ] Holodeck onboarding — a fully immersive sandbox of our best launches.
