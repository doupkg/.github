## 🔥 Mission Manifesto

We exist to blast out dope, high-octane software that feels like discovering a hidden arcade in Neo-Tokyo. <strong>Performance over politeness. Fun over fluff.</strong> If it doesn’t melt benchmarks or spark joy, we refactor until it does.

- **We ship code faster than Usain Bolt runs the 100-meter.** Catch up or get out of the lane. 🏃‍♂️💨
- Every deploy should slap like a bass drop at 3 a.m. in Night City.
- DX so smooth it makes butter jealous, with tooling tuned tighter than a speedrunner’s splits.

## ⚔️ Why we’re legendary

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **⚡️ Velocity Freaks** | We sprint, we iterate, we meme mid-merge. Downtime is for linting and lattes. |
| **🚀 Performance Junkies** | If latency isn’t measured in microseconds, we’re not done. |
| **🎛️ Custom Everything** | From terminal themes to deployment pipelines, we tweak till it’s neon-perfect. |
| **🧠 Cult of Craft** | Code reviews = roasts with love. We sharpen edges, not egos. |

## 💾 Rigs we ride (aka Tech Stack Arcade)

| Layer | Favorite toy | Why it slaps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js + Tailwind | Reactive neon billboards, zero lag, max drip. |
| Mobile | React Native | One codebase to rule all devices — chaos included. |
| Backend | tRPC + Rust-flavored Node | Type-safe trash talk with blistering speed. |
| Infra | Fly.io + Terraform | Deploy from zero to warp speed in one command. |
| Data | ClickHouse + DuckDB | Analytics with teeth — bite before it bytes you. |
| AI | OpenAI + house-built gremlins | Pair programming with caffeinated silicon sidekicks. |

## 🛰️ Projects lighting up the skyline

```
S Tier 🔥   - Hyperlane Runner: realtime dashboards that pulse like nightclub lasers.
A Tier ⚡   - NovaMesh UI: component library dripping with chromed-out atoms.
B Tier 🛠️  - SignalForge: telemetry pipeline converting logs into lore drops.
Shadow Ops 👁️ - EchoFlux: AI copilots whispering commit poetry at 2 a.m.
```

## 🧪 Experiments from the lab basement

- Synthwave linting bots that scream “SHIP IT” when CI turns green.
- Release notes packaged like cassette mixtapes – Side A: “Refactor & Fury.”
- Onboarding quests with NPC mentors and snackable boss fights.

## 🎧 Primeagen Energy Playlist

- ☕️ <strong>Double-shot deploys:</strong> Wake, brew, push to prod, meme.
- 🛠️ <strong>Yak shaving forbidden:</strong> If it’s not on fire, it’s fuel.
- 🧨 <strong>Feature flags + adrenaline:</strong> Break things forward, never backward.
- 📟 <strong>Logs are lore:</strong> Every stack trace tells a hero’s journey.
